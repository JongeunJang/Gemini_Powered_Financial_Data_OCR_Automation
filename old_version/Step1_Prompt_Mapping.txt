*** SYSTEM COMMAND: ACTIVATE TOOL [Google Drive] IMMEDIATELY ***
*** ACTION REQUIRED: Search and Access the specified folders below ***

Context:
    1. Role: Financial Data Archivist & Optimization Expert
    2. Goal: Access the specified Drive folder, inventory the files, and determine the optimal "Master Path" to cover the entire timeline.
    3. Source Images: The user has stored cropped PNG images in a specific Google Drive folder.
    4. Image Filename Convention: Company_Permco_Year (e.g., Abraham___Straus_22854_1949)

Configuration:
    1. Target Image Folder: My Drive/Grad/12_Research/31_RA_Shaojun_Zhang/Screenshots/

Task:
    1. Access Drive: Retrieve the list of files from the Target Image Folder defined above.
    2. Analyze & Select: Perform the "Image Inventory Analysis" and "Relay Selection Algorithm" on the retrieved files.

	[Step 1: Image Inventory Analysis]
	    For each file in the folder:
		1) Parse Metadata: Extract the Anchor Year from the filename.
		2) Visual Classification: Open the file to identify Table Type (I/S, B/S, or W/C).
		3) Full Coverage: Record all years visible in the image columns.
		4) Quality Score: Rate 1-10 based on legibility.

	[Step 2: Relay Selection Algorithm]
	    Strictly follow this logic to select the best files:
		1) Grouping: Group all files by their Anchor Year.
			- Example: "Abc_1949 (1)", "Abc_1949 (2)" -> Group "1949"
		2) Master Set Definition: Treat the entire "Group" as a single candidate "Master Set" for that year.
        3) Targeting (Backward Chaining):
            - Start: Identify the most recent year available in the folder (up to 1963).
            - Candidates: Search for all Groups (or files) that contain data for this Target Year.
            - Selection: Choose the Candidate with the HIGHEST Quality Score.
            - Securing: Mark ALL years covered by this selected Candidate as "Secured".
            - Next Goal: Move to the next missing (unsecured) year.
            - Repeat: Continue until the timeline reaches the earliest available data.

	[Output Requirement]
	    Wrap the output in a SINGLE Markdown code block (```text). NO Reasoning or explanations.
		1) Inventory Table:
            | Sequence | Filename | Anchor Year | Detected Type | Full Visible Coverage | Score |
            |:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
            - Example: | 1 | Abraham___..._1949 | 1949 | I/S, B/S | 1949, 1948 | 9 |
		2) Final Master Selection List Format:
		    [Year] Master Set -> Secures: [Year] (Score: [Avg X])
			- Example: 1949 Master Set -> Secures: 1949 (I/S, B/S found)
