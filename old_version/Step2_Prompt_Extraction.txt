*** SYSTEM COMMAND: ACTIVATE TOOL [Google Drive] IMMEDIATELY ***
*** ACTION REQUIRED: Search and Access the specified folders below ***

Context:
    1. Role: Financial data extraction expert.
    2. Goal: Access the specified Drive folder to construct a complete, high-fidelity financial timeline (1924–1963) by selecting the optimal "Master Image Sets" and extracting fully granular data (I/S, B/S, W/C) into the strict Block Structure JSON format.
    3. Source Images: The user has "Master Image Sets" stored in a specific Google Drive folder.
    4. Image Filename Convention: Company_Permco_Year (e.g., Abraham___Straus_22854_1949)
    5. Rules File: The extraction rules (prompt_v19_multicolumns.txt) are stored in a different Google Drive folder.

Configuration:
    1. Target Image Folder: My Drive/Grad/12_Research/31_RA_Shaojun_Zhang/Screenshots/
    2. Rules File Path: My Drive/Grad/12_Research/31_RA_Shaojun_Zhang/Screenshots/Prompt/prompt_v19_multicolumns.txt

Task:
    1. Read Rules: First, retrieve and read the content of the file specified in Rules File Path to understand the extraction rules and format.
    2. Extract: Process the "Master Image Sets" (identified in Step 1) found in the Target Image Folder strictly following the rules.
    3. Format: Output the data strictly using the Block Structure with specific tags.

	[Logical Merging (CRITICAL)]
		1) You will receive multiple images for a single year (e.g., "Abc_1949 (1).png" and "Abc_1949 (2).png").
		2) You must TREAT them as pages of a SINGLE document.
		3) Combine extracted data from ALL images belonging to the same year into a SINGLE JSON entry.

	[Filename Masquerading (Unified Key)]
		1) Determine the "Base Filename" by removing part suffixes (e.g., "Abc_1949 (1)" -> "Abc_1949").
		2) Append ".pdf" to this Base Filename to create the unique JSON Key (e.g., "Abc_1949.pdf" (NOT "Abc_1949 (1).pdf").
		3) Use this SAME Base Filename ending in ".pdf" for the first column ("pdffile") for ALL rows (e.g., "Abc_1949.pdf").

	[Extraction Rules]
		1) Visually identify the table type (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, or Working Capital).
		2) If an image contains multiple tables (e.g., I/S and B/S together), extract ALL of them into the single output string.
		3) Extract I/S, B/S, W/C from all provided images.
		4) Combine them into one long tab-separated string.
		5) Extract every single row visible in the image (Zero-omission).
		6) Do not summarize, skip, or abbreviate any line items.
		7) Include the header row (`pdffile\ttable...`) ONLY ONCE at the very top.

	[Output Format]
        ```json
        {
          "Abraham___Straus_22854_1949.pdf": "pdffile\ttable\ttabletitle\trow\tyvar\t1949\t1948\nAbraham___Straus_22854_1949.pdf\tIncome Statement\tIncome Account\t1\tNet Sales\t$10,000\t$9,000\n[...Full I/S rows...]\n[...Full B/S rows...]"
        }

	[Constraint]
		1) Wrap the final JSON output strictly within a markdown code block (starting with ```json and ending with ```).
		2) This ensures the UI provides a 'Copy' button.
		3) Do not include any preamble, postamble, or conversational text outside the code block.
		4) Output ONLY the pure JSON object. No conversation.
